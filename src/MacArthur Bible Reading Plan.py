JESUS CHRIST IS LORD

From some of his sermons, pastor John MacArthur recommended reading the Holy Bible in this way: for the Old Testament to read simply from Genesis until Matthew chapter by chapter; for the New Testament to read one smaller Book for a month reading It each day, and then moving onto a larger Book, dividing it into smaller parts and reading those parts each for 30 days. He recommended starting with 1 John, then moving onto John (3 times reading 7 new chapters for 30 days each).
